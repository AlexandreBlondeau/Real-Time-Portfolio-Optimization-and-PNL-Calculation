# Real-Time Portfolio Optimization and PNL Calculation

## Description

This Python project provides a framework for portfolio optimization and real-time Profit and Loss (PNL) calculation. It encompasses advanced features like risk management and transaction cost optimization. Designed for robustness and scalability, the code also employs parallelization techniques to improve computational performance.

## Features

- **Real-Time PNL Calculation**: Updates the PNL based on current portfolio positions and prices.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Uses quadratic programming to find the optimal asset weights in the portfolio.
- **Advanced Risk Management**: Computes risk measures like Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR).
- **Transaction Cost Optimization**: Accounts for transaction costs in portfolio optimization.
- **Parallelization and GPU Acceleration**: Utilizes the Joblib library for CPU parallelization and annotations for GPU acceleration.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Joblib

## Usage

1. Clone this GitHub repository.
2. Install the above-mentioned dependencies.
3. Run the `Complete_Portfolio_Optimization_Code.py` file.
